#Create a Python script 02_problem4.py with one variable year and displays whether year is a leap year. A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4, but not by 100 unless it is divisible by 400. Commit your Python script to your GitHub repository. Submit your script, a screenshot of your terminal, and a screenshot of your entire browser window showing your GitHub repository.
year = 2020
if (year % 4 == 0):
	if (year %100 ==0):
		if (year % 400 == 0):
			print ('Year is a leap year')
		else:
			print ('Year is not a leap year')
	else:
			print ('Year is a leap year')
else:
		print ('Year is not a leap year')
